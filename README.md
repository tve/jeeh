# JeeH

Headers for framework- and platform-agnostic code.

* This code can be used in combination with arduino, libopencm3, mbed, and other frameworks.
* A good C++ compiler with C++11 support is essential, due to heavy use of C++ templates.
* The resulting code is small (_really small_, sometimes) and fast (_really fast_, sometimes).
* Everything here is in flux. API's will change, as better idioms are being discovered.
* This library is intended for use with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/lib/show/3082/JeeH): just add `JeeH` to `lib_deps`.

### Examples

### License

JeeH wants to stand on the shoulders of giants. As every giant tends to prefer
its own license scheme (that's one of the perks of being a giant), JeeH bows in
total worship for each them and lives in the public domain. Do as you wish.
